## 📌 Overview

This project provides a fully automated script that transforms the default Parrot OS terminal into a Kali Linux–style ZSH environment, designed specifically for cybersecurity students and training labs.

The script installs, configures, and optimizes everything automatically without requiring any manual intervention.

---

## ✨ Features

✔ ZSH as the default shell (user & root)  
✔ Oh-My-Zsh installed for both user and root  
✔ ZSH Autosuggestions enabled  
✔ ZSH Syntax Highlighting enabled  
✔ Kali Linux–style smart prompt  
✔ Automatic root detection  
✔ Root shell starts in /home/parrot  
✔ Stable and repeatable setup

## 🧪 Tested Environment

- Operating System: Parrot OS (Home & Security Editions)
- Architecture: x86_64
- Shell: ZSH
- Tested on fresh installations and student lab machines
